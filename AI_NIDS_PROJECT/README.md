# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System

This project demonstrates an AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
using Machine Learning (Random Forest) and Streamlit.

## Features
- Simulated network traffic (CIC-IDS2017 style)
- Random Forest classifier
- Real-time intrusion detection
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard

## How It Works
The system trains a machine learning model on network traffic features
and detects whether incoming traffic is benign or malicious.

## Deployment
This application is deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud.
