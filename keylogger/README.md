# 🔐 GUI-Based Keyboard Event Logger 

A Python-based **GUI Keyboard Event Monitoring Application** developed using **Tkinter** and **pynput**.  
This project is designed strictly for **educational and learning purposes** to demonstrate keyboard event handling, multithreading, GUI development, and secure logging practices.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional command-line tools for monitoring keyboard activity lack usability, real-time control, and structured logging mechanisms. There is a need for a user-friendly, GUI-based application that can capture keyboard events in a controlled environment while maintaining system responsiveness and ethical software practices.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- To capture keyboard events such as key press, hold, and release
- To provide a GUI-based interface for controlling logging
- To store logged data in both structured and human-readable formats
- To ensure smooth execution using multithreading
- To promote ethical and educational use of system-level monitoring tools

---

## 🚀 Features

- Graphical User Interface using Tkinter
- Start and Stop logging using buttons
- Logs stored in:
  - `logs.json` (structured format)
  - `logs.txt` (human-readable format)
- Multithreaded execution (GUI does not freeze)
- Clean and beginner-friendly Python code
- Ethical and controlled logging approach
